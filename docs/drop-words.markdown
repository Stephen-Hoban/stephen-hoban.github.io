Word Rug is designed as an endless word search puzzle game. Because the sliding tile is such a common and intuitive element in mobile games like match 3, the board responds to other popular match 3 and merge mechanics. I started working on this as a way to practice string manipulation, and word casual for mobile felt like fertile ground for that. The board will keep dropping new words forever but, the game will progress through levels that give players directed goals. Art is TK etc. but it's just waiting on me to come up with the original title that SEOs but doesn't sound like it's read from a tickertape.
