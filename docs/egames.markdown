“Swords and Sandals Spartacus” is a retro 2D platformer adventure game from the developer of the classic “Swords and Sandals” franchise. Based on the legendary historical gladiator who fought for his freedom against the Roman legions, it features 20 levels of intense, fast-paced combat action.

“Swords and Sandals Spartacus” was published by eGames and Whiskeybarrel Studios in 2019 and is currently available on Steam. I worked as an assistant developer for the PC edition of the game, focused on building functionality in Unity. I also oversaw the game's iOS and Android ports and designed its custom controls.

<h2>Quiz Rewards</h2>

Quiz Rewards was a iOS and Android free-to-play trivia game published by eGames. I built the front end in Unity. It incorporated login features, ad mediation, in-app purchase functionality, analytics, and Firebase. Cash Quizz Rewards launched on iOS and Android in 2020; after two years live it was incorporated into the trivia offerings of Buzztime Entertainment Networks. I built the game to match existing designs as well as product managed the launch and early live operations, and I enjoyed the project particularly for the challenge of how to make a game stand out when the market for that genre is saturated.
