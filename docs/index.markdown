Hello world. I'm Stephen and I'm glad you're here. I am a game developer working in Unity and C#. My interests are game development, working in Unity, and C#.  <br/>

This portfolio offers a sampling of projects I have designed, written, produced and/or developed over the past few years. 

I specialize in building games for mobile devices but I also enjoy tailoring projects for AR, PC, web, and custom systems. 

I'm available for contract software development, product management/project management, and narrative design for games, sort-of games, and non-games.
