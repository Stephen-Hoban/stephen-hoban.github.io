<h4>AR Experiment</h4>

I created Chelsea Waterside to pursue a hunch that memory is a use cases for augmented reality. AR's "magic" reminds me in many ways of spectral photography, which was an early proof of technology and viral hit for the recently invented film camera. And just like the camera was then, today the AR camera device is a tool that helps us see ghosts.

This project is a version of a 3D mobile game I had built in Unity and Blender for my son Heath a few years ago. Heath is autistic, and since he was old enough to walk, Chelsea Waterside was his favorite playground in New York City. In the summer, its three enormous water fountains would entertain him for hours on end. All winter long he would draw pictures of them, with little magical additions he imagined, as we waited for summer to return.

Designed by a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/45398879@N02/4854075152">prominent landscape architect</a> from a plan selected in a city sponsored competition, Chelsea Waterside’s fountains, with their Seussian forms, were a cringeworthy fixture for neighborhood parents but a hit with children. In the spring of 2018, public pressure won out and the playground was torn down and renovated. To be honest, the playground that would replace it was undeniably superior in every last respect. But still, it wasn't the old Chelsea Waterside. My son's favorite water fountains were gone forever.

Heath was also a prodigy at iPad games, and  we shared nice moments playing games together . I put Chelsea Waterside’s three water fountains into a game to help him say goodbye to a place that was so special to him. It’s a stim, but for us it's also a conjuring, a way to revisit the spirit of a place we still haven’t forgotten.
