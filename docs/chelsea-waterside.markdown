<h1>Chelsea Waterside AR</h1>


![Chelsea Waterside 3D](/images/CW.water.png)

Chelsea Waterside AR chases a hunch about memory as a natural use case for augmented reality. Sort of like how spectral photography was an early hit application of the camera in the 19th century, the AR camera is a tool to help us see ghosts.

This project is a version of a 3D mobile game I had built in Unity and Blender for my son a few years ago. My son is autistic, and since he was old enough to walk, Chelsea Waterside was his favorite playground in New York City. In the summer, its three enormous water fountains would entertain him for hours. All winter long he would even draw pictures of the fountains, with magical additions he wanted to see, waiting for summer to return.

Designed by a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/45398879@N02/4854075152">prominent landscape architect</a> from a plan selected in a city sponsored competition, Chelsea Waterside’s fountains, owing to their, um, ostentatiously Seussian forms, were an embarrassing fixture for local parents but a hit with children. In the spring of 2018, in a deteriorating state and under public pressure, the playground was torn down and renovated. My son's favorite water fountains were gone forever.

My son was also a prodigy at iPad kids games, and playing games together were some nice moments we shared as he was growing up. I put Chelsea Waterside’s three water fountains into a game to help him say goodbye to a place that was so special to him. It’s a place we still haven’t forgotten.
