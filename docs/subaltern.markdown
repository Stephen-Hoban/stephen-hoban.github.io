<h1>Force Majeure Projects</h1>

<h2>Trains Go By</h2>

Pending resource extraction

I completely bricked this one, and it was a stupid, stupid move. I was still prototyping and I was being sloppy. Not only were my backup sporadics, I didn't even bother to change the default project scene name. Neither did the asset store asset I imported, overwriting the entire scene. I git every last little thing now. It was meant to be a New York subway rhythm game in a retro pixel style, inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S43IwBF0uM">inherently musical nature of trains</a>. I plan to bring it back in an infinite runner style to add an early Guitar Hero feel.


<h2>When Earth Met Sky</h2>

<br />
“How Earth Met Sky” was an interactive storybook for Ithacan Mythologies, part of a planned series telling the story of the creation of the world in Greek mytholog. earth and sky fell in love, and their children became the gods we all know. I had built the project in Unity using the Fungus scripting system.
