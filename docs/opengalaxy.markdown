The OpenGalaxy is a customizable personal mythology and planet builder. It puts the player in the position of god at the moment of creation, to develop civilizations with unique customs of worship, set in a multiplayer universe of fellow gods and planet holders. It's an expansive and open project, by definition. I think of it as a UGC application of the infinite monkeys theorem applied to the evolution of human belief: how differently would our understanding of the supernatural develop, given another chance? The player's exploration of that question finds its expression in a powerful PvP battle mechanic called the Strike. 

The openGalaxy's cosmos can be browsed on the web through the project's <a href="https://www.opengalaxy.com/galaxy" target="_blank">galaxy map</a>, and an expanded planet maker tool designed for iOS is currently in <a href="mailto: stephen@opengalaxy.com?subject=Add me to the closed beta">closed beta</a>. It supports, but does not require, <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/opengalaxy-stars" target="_blank">the blockchain</a>. The central game is tentatively set for mobile release around the 2024 Perseids.
