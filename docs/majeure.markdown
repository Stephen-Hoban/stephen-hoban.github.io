When Earth Met Sky was an interactive storybook for <A href="ithacan.html">Ithacan Mythologies</a>, part of a planned series telling the story of the creation of the world in Greek mythology, illustrated by children's author Sofia Zarabouka. It told the first chapter of the Greek theogony, how the earth and the sky met, fell in love, and gave birth to the generation of Titans.  I had built the project in Unity using the Fungus scripting system.

I completely bricked this one, and it was a stupid, stupid move. It was still an early prototype and I was being sloppyâ€”  my backups were sporadic, and I didn't even bother to change the default project scene name. But then neither did the asset store asset I imported, overwriting the entire scene. So that's the story of the last time I didn't use git. Trains Go By was meant to be a New York subway rhythm game in a retro pixel style, inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S43IwBF0uM" target="_blank">inherently musical nature of trains</a>. My son still likes it so it may come back. I was thinking of trying in an infinite runner style for that early Guitar Hero feel.
